## Original MP5 Implementation
### Memory Allocation

- **Tile Loading:** `main.cpp::getTiles`
    - The program loads `n` tile images from disk.
    - Each `TileImage` object potentially stores a copy of the pixel data from the source PNG. This leads to an initial memory footprint roughly proportional to $n×AvgPNGSize$.
    - Each Tile Image object have a copy of `image` and `resized_` which cost a lot memory usage
- **KD-Tree Construction:** `KDTree::KDTree`
    - The `KDTree` constructor creates a copy of the input vector of points (`pointsList = newPoints;`). If the input is the vector of average tile colors, this adds memory proportional to $n×Dim$ (where Dim is 3 for HSL colors).
    - The tree itself stores nodes, requiring memory proportional to n.
- **Mosaic Canvas Storage:** `MosaicCanvas::setTile`
    - The `MosaicCanvas` stores a `vector` of `TileImage*` pointers, pointing to the original tile images. The size of this vector is $w×h$. The memory overhead of the pointers themselves is relatively small.
- **Mosaic Drawing:** `MosaicCanvas::drawMosaic`
	 - ==Multiple Unnecessary Resizing & Memory Allocation==
    - A large PNG is created with dimensions based on the number of tiles (w,h) and `pixelsPerTile`. This allocation can be significant: $w×h×(pixelsPerTile)^2×BytesPerPixel$.
    - Crucially, the `TileImage::paste` function calls `generateResizedImage` if a cached resized version (`resized_`) doesn't exist.
    - `generateResizedImage` allocates memory for the `resized_` PNG within the `TileImage` object, sized `pixelsPerTile x pixelsPerTile`. Because this happens inside the loop within `drawMosaic` for potentially every tile placement (w×h times), even if the same `TileImage` is reused, this repeated allocation/deallocation and temporary storage contributes significantly to both runtime and peak memory usage during the drawing phase. 

### Running Time

- **Tile Loading:** `main.cpp::getTiles`
    - Reading `n` PNG files from disk and calculating average colors takes time proportional to the total number of pixels across all tile images, roughly $O(n×w'×h')$, where w′ and h′ are average tile dimensions.
- **KD-Tree Construction:** `KDTree::KDTree`
    - Building the KD-Tree involves finding medians recursively. The `select` function, using QuickSelect via `partition`.
    - The overall average construction time is dominated by the partitioning at each level, leading to approximately $O(n \log n)$ complexity.
- **Mosaic Population (`mapTiles`):**
    - This involves iterating through w×h regions in the source image.
    - For each region, finding the nearest neighbor in the KD-Tree takes $O(\log n)$ on average.
    - There's also a map lookup (`tile_avg_map`) which takes $O(\log n)$.
    - The total average time for this phase is roughly $O(w×h×\log n)$.
- **Mosaic Drawing:** `MosaicCanvas::drawMosaic`, `TileImage::paste`
    - The nested loops iterate $w×h$ times.
    - Inside the loop, `TileImage::paste` potentially calls `TileImage::generateResizedImage`.
    - `generateResizedImage` involves complex pixel averaging over the area of the original tile image corresponding to the `pixelsPerTile x pixelsPerTile` output size. **This resizing operation is repeated for every tile placement, even for identical tiles**. This leads to a runtime roughly proportional to $O(w×h×(pixelsPerTile)2×TilePixelCalculationTime)$, which can be very slow for large mosaics.
- **IO log file**: 
	- ==This is the most significant bottleneck.==
	- Each time when using `cout` to print the log information of the program, it will consume a lot time to implement IO with the terminal.
  

## Optimizations for MP6


**1. Optimize `MosaicCanvas::drawMosaic` Runtime:**

- **Problem:** The `TileImage::generateResizedImage` function is called repeatedly inside `drawMosaic`, even for the same tile image, causing massive redundant computation.
- **Solution (Caching):** Introduce a cache within `MosaicCanvas::drawMosaic` to store resized versions of `TileImage` objects. Before calling `paste` (and thus potentially `generateResizedImage`), check if a resized version for that specific `TileImage` already exists. This method can save significantly unnecessary resizing time and memory allocation.
- **Impact:** This should drastically reduce the runtime of `drawMosaic`. Resizing happens once per unique tile image used, not once per tile placement. This directly addresses the slowness noted in Observation 2. 

**2. Optimize KD-Tree Construction Memory:**

- **Problem:** The `KDTree` constructor copies the entire input point vector (`pointsList = newPoints;`).
- **Solution:** Modify the constructor and helper functions (`RecursiveBuilder`, `select`, `partition`) to operate on the input vector by const reference (`const vector<Point<Dim>>&`), iterators, or pointers, avoiding the initial copy. 
- **Impact:** Reduces peak memory usage during tree construction by the size of the copied vector.

**3. Optimize `TileImage` Memory Usage:**

- **Problem:** Each `TileImage` potentially stores its own copy of cropped pixel data (`image_`).
- **Solution:** Each TileImage contains member variables of `image_` and `resized_`, which consumes a lot of memory. To save memory, I have replaced a `image_` member with a `filepath` string to store the corresponding location of the image .  
- **Impact:** Could significantly reduce the initial memory required to store tile data (n×PNG). Complexity increases due to lifetime management.

**4. Optimize `IO` runtime**``

- **Problem:** The IO logfile will consume a lot of time when communicating with the terminal.
- **Solution:** Set `enable_output=false` 
- **Impact:** Shorten runtime to half of the initial runtime.

**5. Optimize Maptile Time**
- **Problem**: paste maptiles to each location cost a lot of time, and this process can be implemented parallel
- **Solution:** Apply multithread to speed up runnning time
- **Impact:** Speed up running time significantly
