## Definition

   Study companies from:
   - Quality of management
   - Labor relations
   - Inventory control
   - PE ratio and EPS growth rate(P/E: price to earning ratio; EPS: Earnings per share 关注市盈率与每股利润的比率 )
   - Return on equity and assets
   - Supply and Demand
   - Macroeconomica Factors
2. Limits(unable to):
   - Measure timing of investment

   - Quantifying the rish & reward

## Availability of information

1. Company reported Financial statements:
   - The balcance sheet(负债表):  
     assets: anything of value that can be converted into cash or used to generate cash
     1. components:  
        $$ Assets = -Liabilities + Shareholderequity$$
        - Liability(债务): Debt the company has including Bonds(债券), Equity and Taxes
        - Shareholder Equity: How much the Shareholder have
     2. Types:

        - Tangible
     3. Common ratios:
        - Quick Ratio: Liquid Assets/ Current Liabilities
        - Cuurent Ratio: Current Assets/ Current Liabilities
        - Debt to Equlity: Total Liabilities/ Share Holder Equity
   - The income statement:
     - Top line: gross income before any consideration of cost(总收入)

     - Bottom line:Net income after all cost considerations
   - Cash Flow:
     - Receivables: Amount a company is owed, but not yet paid
     - Payables: Amount a company is required to pay, but no tyet fulfilled
     - Depreciation(折旧费用): allocate the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life(衡量有使用年限的资产的价值)
     - Amortization: similar to depreciation but applied to intangible assets, spread the cost of the intangible asset over its expected useful life.
     - Common ratios:  
       $$\text{current liabilities coverage} = \frac{\text{operating cash flow}}{\text{current liabilities}}$$
     
2. Macroeconomic data

## Fundamental analysis

### Macroeconomics Analysis

1. Global Economy Analysis:
   - affects exports, price competition and profits
   - exchange(汇率): purchasing power and earnings
2. Domestic Economy:
   - Gross Domestic Product(GDP): measures the economy's total outputs of goods and services
   - Employment rate: measures the extent that the economy is operating at full capacity
   - Inflation: measures the general level of prices increase Phillip's curve
   - Interest Rate: high interest rate reduces liquidity of cash
   - Budget Deficit(预算赤字):large deficit means more borrowing, which implies higher interest rate
   - Sentiment: consumers and producers confidence
   - Business cycle terms:  
     peak: the end of expansion and start of recession  
     trough: the bottom of the recession  
     defensive industries: little sensitive to business cycles 

### Industry Analysis

1. Two factors that determine the sensitivity of a firm's earning to business conditions: business risks and financial risks
2. Business risks:
   - Sales sensitivity to business condition  
     The degree to which the sales of a product or service are affected by changes in a particular factor(产品或服务是否易受外界条件影响)
   - Operating leverage: the division between the fixed and variable cost  
     The firms with greater amounts of variables cost are subject less to business fluctuations, thus more stable
 3. Financial risks:
    - the degree in using financial leverage
    - leverage firm is more sensitive to business cycles(easily to be influenced by financial market)
4. Industry cycles:
   1. General stages: start-up, consolidation, maturity, decline

### Equity Valuation Model

  Equity Valuation Model(股权估值模型):  
      - Dividend Discount Model(DDM，股权折现模型):  
        1. idea: the stock is worth the sum of all its future dividend payments  
        2. Equation:  
           $$ V = \sum{\frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t}}$$  
           r: the discount rate(回报率)  
           $D_t$:第t年每股分红(dividend)  
      - constant growth model:  
        1. idea: 认为dividend成指数增长  
        2. Equation:  
           $$V = \sum{\frac{D_0 * (1+g)^t}{(1+r)^t}}$$  
      - derivation of expected return: **r**  
        1. Expected return = dividend yield(股息收益率) + capital gain(资本收益)  
        2. Equation:  
           $$ r = \frac{D_1}{P_0}+\frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}$$  
           rearrange->  
           $$ P_0 = \frac{D_1}{1+r}+\frac{P_1}{1+r}$$  
           同理，我们有  
           $$ P_1 = \frac{D_2 + P_2}{1+r}\ \  \text{and}  \ \ P_2 = \frac{D_3 + P_3}{1+r}$$  
           则可推出  
           $$P_0 = \sum{\frac{D_i}{(1+r)^i}}$$  
      - **PVGO**: present value of growth opportunities  
        1.Idea: evaluate the captical gain g  
           $r = \frac{D_i}{P_0} + g$  , $g = plowback rate * ROE$  
        2. Explanation:  
           - ROE:  
             $$\text{Return on Equity} = \frac{\text{Earnings per share}}{\text{Equity Per Share}}$$  
           - Plowback rate = 1 - Payoutrate

### Financial Statement Analysis

1. Use/source of Fund Statement:
   - sources of fund: where is the money come from
   - use of fund: how is the money being spent
2. Ratio Analysis:
   - Assets - Sales - Profit
   - Liquidity Ratio
   - Risk Ratio
   - Du Pond Analysis
